# java-community-clinic-system
You are building a console-based system for a small community clinic.

The clinic needs help managing:

* Patients
* Check-ins
* Appointments
* Daily reports

Your job is to design and build the system step-by-step.

---

# Skills Being Tested

This project will assess your understanding of:

* Variables
* Methods
* Loops
* Conditionals
* Arrays
* ArrayList
* Objects and Classes

You must demonstrate clean structure and logical thinking.

---

# Required Files

Create the following classes:

* `YourNamePatient.java`
* `YourNameAppointment.java`
* `YourNameClinicSystem.java`
* `YourNameClinicApp.java` (Main class)

You may add additional helper methods if needed.

# Tier 1 — Patient Management

Build the foundation.

Your system must allow the user to:

1. Add a new patient
2. View all patients
3. Check in a patient
4. Search for a patient
5. Exit

Requirements:

* Store patients using an `ArrayList`
* Assign each patient a unique ID
* Use methods (no large main method)
* Use loops for searching and listing
* Use conditionals for validation

---

# Tier 2 — Appointment Scheduling

Now the clinic needs scheduling.

Add:

* An array representing daily time slots
* Ability to schedule appointments
* Ability to cancel appointments
* View the full schedule

Requirements:

* Prevent double-booking a time slot
* Validate input
* Store appointments using an `ArrayList`

---

# Tier 3 — Clinic Business Rules

Make it realistic.

Add:

* Daily summary report
* Appointment completion tracking
* Rules that prevent invalid actions
* Basic waitlist feature

Your system should now behave like a small real clinic system.

# Creative Extension (Choose ONE)

Choose **one** of the following stretch challenges to extend your project.
This is your opportunity to show deeper understanding and creativity.

1. **Priority Patients**
   Add a priority level (Emergency, Regular, Follow-up) and adjust scheduling behavior.

2. **Multiple Doctors**
   Add a Doctor class and assign appointments to specific doctors.

3. **File Saving (Persistence)**
   Save patient and appointment data to a text file and reload it when the program starts.

4. **Search Filters**
   Allow searching patients by phone number or appointment status.

5. **Improved Reporting**
   Add more detailed daily statistics (e.g., busiest hour, total cancellations).

6. **Rescheduling Feature**
   Allow appointments to be moved to a different time slot safely.

7. **Patient Visit History**
   Track and display a patient’s previous completed appointments.

8. **Billing Simulation**
   Add cost tracking and print a simple receipt.

9. **Input Validation System**
   Create a reusable validation method for all user inputs.

10. **Console UI Upgrade**
    Improve the user interface with formatted menus and clearer output layout.

You may choose more than one once you finish early.

* University Advising Office
* Tech Support Desk
* Event Ticketing Desk
* Coffee Shop Pickup System
* Vet Clinic
